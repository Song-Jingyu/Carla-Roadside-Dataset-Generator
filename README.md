# Carla-Roadside-Dataset-Generator
This repository aims to build an open-source package based on [Carla](https://carla.org/) to generate a roadside dataset with different sensing modalities.

## Credit
I want to say thanks to the developers of [Carla](https://carla.org/) and [Carla-2DBBOX](https://github.com/MukhlasAdib/CARLA-2DBBox). This package cannot be developed so fast without the help from the open-source community.

## How to Use
